## Portfolio Projects

### Project 1: eCommerce Customer Behavior Analysis
**Goal**: To understand customer behavior and identify strategies to retain more customers.

**Code**: [eCommerce Customer Behavior Analysis](https://github.com/Abrahamkaikobad/ecommerce-customer-behavior-analysis)

**Overview**: The dataset includes 10,000 entries with 16 features related to customer behavior, including age, product category, and purchasing patterns. The data was already clean, which allowed for direct analysis and visualization.

**Technology**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, MS Excel, Power BI, MS PowerPoint

**Key Insights**:
1. **Predominant Buyer Age Group**: The average customer age is 44, with the most common age being 51, showing that middle-aged and older customers are the main demographic.
2. **Top Product Categories**: The most purchased product categories are **Electronics, Clothing, and Toys**, highlighting a preference for these items when shopping online.
3. **Customer Loyalty**: Around **50% of customers are return buyers**, indicating a stable but improvable retention rate.
4. **Payment Method Preference**: **Bank transfers** are the most popular payment method, especially among middle-aged and older customers due to their security and ease.
5. **Minimal Impact of Discounts**: Discounts only result in a **1% increase in average purchase amounts**, indicating limited influence on customer spending behavior.

### Project 2: Digital Wallet Transaction Analysis
**Goal**: To analyze digital wallet transactions to understand customer behavior, spending patterns, and merchant performance.

**Code**: [Digital Wallet Transaction Analysis](https://github.com/Abrahamkaikobad/digital-wallet)

**Overview**: The dataset contains 5000 synthetic records of digital wallet transactions, including various financial details such as product_category, product_amount, cashback, loyalty_points, and payment_method. This analysis provides insights into customer spending, transaction trends, and potential areas for business optimization.

**Technology**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Power BI

**Key Insights**:
1. **Top Product Categories**: Streaming Services and Gas Bill are among the highest contributors to revenue.
2. **Customer Loyalty**: About 48% of transactions are from return users, indicating moderate customer retention.
3. **High Cashback Categories**: Categories such as Streaming Services offer significant cashback, attracting more customers.
4. **Preferred Payment Methods**: UPI and credit card payments are the most commonly used.
5. **Top Merchants**: Airbnb and Flipkart lead in terms of transaction volume and revenue.

### Project 3: Global Superstore Data Analysis
**Goal**: To conduct a comprehensive analysis of the global superstore dataset to gain insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and profitability.

**Code**: [Global Superstore Data Analysis](https://github.com/Abrahamkaikobad/sales-analysis)

**Overview**: The dataset consists of 51,290 entries with 24 features, providing detailed information on customer orders, including Order ID, Customer Name, Segment, City, State, Sales, Profit, Quantity, and Discount. The dataset is clean and ready for analysis, with the aim of identifying purchasing patterns, key revenue drivers, and factors influencing profit margins.

**Technology**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), MS Excel, Power BI

**Key Insights**:
1. **Sales & Profit Analysis**: Detailed insights into top-performing products, regions, and categories by sales and profit.
2. **Customer Segmentation**: Analysis of purchasing behavior segmented by customer type and region.
3. **Discount Impact**: Investigation into the effects of discounts on profitability and sales volume.
4. **Shipping & Order Priorities**: Analysis of how shipping costs and order priorities affect delivery time and customer satisfaction.
5. **Profitability Drivers**: Identification of key factors contributing to high-profit margins.

### Project 4: Identifying Hate Speech on Online Platforms in Bangladesh
**Goal**: To develop and evaluate machine learning models for detecting hate speech in Bangla and Banglish text on online platforms.

**Code**: [Identifying Hate Speech on Online Platforms](https://github.com/Abrahamkaikobad/Identifying-Hate-Speech-on-Online-Platform-in-Bangladesh-Using-Machine-Learning/tree/master)

**Overview**: This project involved analyzing a dataset of 12,131 entries with three main features: bangla, banglish, and label. The objective was to preprocess the text, vectorize it using TF-IDF, and build classification models to detect various types of hate speech.

**Technology**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK), Machine Learning (SVM, Random Forest, MLP, Decision Tree), Data Preprocessing (TF-IDF Vectorization, Stopwords Removal), Pickle, Joblib

**Key Insights**:
1. **Data Structure**: The dataset contains balanced labels after applying SMOTE, with categories such as Personal, Neutral, Religious, Political, and Geopolitical.
2. **Text Cleaning**: Advanced text preprocessing techniques were applied, including stopword removal and tokenization, for both Bangla and Banglish text.
3. **Model Performance**:
   - **SVM Classifier**: Achieved ~89.5% accuracy.
   - **Random Forest Classifier**: Reached ~90.7% accuracy.
   - **MLP Classifier**: Best performance with ~91.9% accuracy.
4. **Real-Time Input Handling**: Developed pipelines to predict the label for new text inputs using trained vectorizers and models.
5. **Model Deployment**: Saved trained models and vectorizers for future use using Pickle and Joblib.

**Future Enhancements**:
- Integration of deep learning techniques such as LSTM and BERT for more robust text classification.
- Addition of more complex linguistic features for better model generalization.
